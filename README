NAME
       rubin - coordinate conversion between RUBIN and RT90

SYNOPSIS
       rubin coordinate
       rubin --help

DESCRIPTION
       rubin is a small utility for safely converting between coordinates
       according to RT90 and according to RUBIN.

       Provide a coordinate in either notation (see below for the syntax)
       and  it  will be printed in the other notation. Resolution is pre-
       served, except [...]

   RT90
       RT90 (also known as Rikets nät, the Swedish grid) is the most pop-
       ular coordinate system for use in Sweden.  Although  SWEREF 99  is
       slowly replacing it, lots of existing data is expressed in RT90.

   RUBIN
       RUBIN  is  in  reality  a set of standards and conventions used in
       biological surveys, but in this context it's synonymous  with  the
       coordinate  format  included therein. It's really just a different
       encoding or notation for RT90, designed to be (among other things)
       more compact. During the 1980s it gradually fell out of use, but a
       lot of data from that time period is still encoded in RUBIN.

       The  RUBIN  part  is  based entirely on Björkbäck's (1980) text; I
       have not had access to Österdahl (1976). In fact,  information  on
       RUBIN is surprisingly hard to find today.
